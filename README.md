## Install

To install the system, run the following commands
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kapteinstein/proglab2_robot
$ sudo ln -s /home/$USER/proglab2_robot/plab-robot.service /etc/systemd/system/plab-robot.service
$ sudo systemct enable plab-robot # disable to disable autostart
```

The robot will now fetch a new version every time it is booted with a connected ethernet cable. The `main.py` is also executed automatically.

To see the status of the execution (after latest boot), run:

```bash
$ sudo journalctl -u plab-robot -b
```

To stop and start the execution run
```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop plab-robot # You can now run other test stuff
$ sudo systemctl start plab-robot

```
